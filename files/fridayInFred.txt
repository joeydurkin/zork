The goal given at the start is to eat a delicious slice of Benny's Pizza. You'll want to
gear up along the way. 
NPCs all drop some good items that help in combat. The most notable "puzzle" is getting 
out of the Dungeon below Citgo (s,d,s,e,e,n,d). To do this, you have to kill the raccoon 
in the Dumpster you passed along the way, the moldySandwich it drops will teleport you 
when you eat it. You will be rewarded with the best armor in the game and a healing weapon,
which will make the rest of the game much easier.
To get the slice of pizza, go to Benny Vitali's (s,d,s,e,e,e,e,e,s,s). When you eat the
pizza, which gives you a full restore of health, a mysterious civil war enthusiast hands
you a note, redefining your goal of victory. To quell your hunger for the heart of the
Confederacy, you have to backtrack to the Confederate Cemetery you passed along the way.
Fighting the ghostOfRobertELee is by far the hardest fight, so look out for items that
can heal you, or bring a friend to keep smacking you with the bullWhip! Once the ghost
is defeated, eat his heart to win.
