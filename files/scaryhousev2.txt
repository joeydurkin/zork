You will first have to choose the number of players, choose 1 player. When 
you are presented with the options of classes to choose from, select bodyguard.
Your first objective is to find items to defend yourself when you encounter
NPCs. You will start the dungeon on the front porch. Go east to the garage,
equip the TrenchCoat, and head east, back to the porch. From the porch, go
west to the Alley, equip the trashcanlid, and go east, back to the porch once
again. From the porch, go north to the living room, up to the bedroom, and east 
to the bathroom. Be careful in this area, as you may encounter the Rat. If you 
do encounter the rat, you can fight it or simply ignore it and keep moving, the 
rat won't be able to hurt you very much. Take the painkillers in the bathroom, 
you may need them to heal later on. Go south to the closet, down to the secret
office, east to the greenhouse, and east to the backyard. From the backyard, go
north to the shed, where you will find the LawnMowerBlade. Equip the LawnMowerBlade,
and go south to the backyard. From the backyard, go east to the field, down to the
sewer, and south to the deep sewer. Check your inventory to make sure you have the
TrenchCoat, TrashcanLid, and LawnmowerBlade equipped. It is also wise to check your
health. If your health is not 100%, swallow the painkillers. Finally, go up to the
Meeting Room. There will be a hostile MafiaBoss here. The MafiaBoss is a strong NPC,
but at this point you are well equipped. Attack the MafiaBoss until he dies. When 
the MafiaBoss is dead, look around and you will see that he dropped a StackOfCash.
smell the cash, and you will win.
