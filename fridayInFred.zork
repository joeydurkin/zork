Rooms:
Dorm room
contents:dirtyClothes,broom
You are standing in your freshman year room. Having never lived away from home,
you have lived like a pig in a sty. Your dirty clothes have sat so long that
they could form a hardened, protective shell for you. You can feel within the 
deepest depths of your soul that a slice of Benny Vitali's pizza would change 
your life.
---
Russell Hall
contents:paddle,ball
The lobby is dimly lit, and it reeks of freshman body odor from all the stairs
with bitter notes from upperclassmen jealously of the new AC units.
---
Bathroom
contents:40,toilet,shower,trashCanLid
If you thought your room was bad, this is worse. The cleaning staff went on
strike long ago. The toilet seats are wet, the walls are wet, the ground is wet,
everything is wet. The trashcans are overflowing with personal trash.
---
Stairs
contents:squirrelCorpse
The fresh air feels nice. There is a tree with branches overhead, and shoes
hanging by their laces from them. You are far too tired to climb the rest of
the top of the stairs.
---
Basement
contents:tidePod
The basement is home to the laundry room. Rarely used, yet somehow, all the
machines are taken. Clothes sit on top of the machine in sad, forgotten heaps.
The vending machine in the hallway is all but picked clean.
---
Parking lot
There are no empty parking spaces because there are never any empty parking
spaces. There are rowdy, soon-to-be dropout hooligans smoking cigs and blasting
music of The Strokes.
---
Dumpster
It's dark and it smells, well, like a dumpster. What did you expect?
---
Marshall Hall
It is unfamiliar, not as fun, and worst of all, farther down the hill than
Russell. Best leave.
---
William and Sunken
The cars whizz by, not yielding to anyone, let alone you. The UMW sign stands
in the corner. Nifty, you think.
---
William and Littlepage
contents:gasoline,atm
The Citgo gas station stands on this corner. The high gas prices fill your heart
with sadness. The stranger of the Fredericksburg locals occupy this parking lot.
---
Citgo
contents:chips,soda
The whir and white light of the wall refrigerators are the most appealing part 
of the store. There is a hyper-sexualized wall decal of Dick Cheney holding some
Coronas. Oddly, it makes you want to find your beachÂ®.
---
Dungeon
contents:leatherSuit,bullWhip
Remember that scene from Pulp Fiction? Yeah, it's just that. Good luck getting
out of this one!
---
William and Kenmore
The sweet smell of donuts of donuts mixes with the enticing aroma of Mexican
food, and wafts its way into your sinuses. The resulting combination is
literally coming to life!
---
Sugar Shack
contents:bostonCreme,rainbowSprinkles,blueberryCake,saliva
The assortment of donuts in the display case seem to almost glow. You think
they are impeccable. As the saliva drips down your chin, it begins to pool at
your feet. The cashier seems largely unphased, it must be normal.
---
Soup and Taco II
It's deserted. You double check the hours and read "Closed at all times
convenient." You are filled with disappointment.
---
Down the road
In this nondescript area, all you feel is the pain of your feet and ache of your
legs as you make this long, arduous trek.
---
Confederate Cemetery
A fog rolls in among the tombstones. The sound of the cars, the wind, and all
of the world outside fades away. It's cold now, and your steady breathing is
the only sound you hear. Suddenly, with a flash and a horse's neigh, the Ghost
of Robert E. Lee appears!
---
William and Caroline
This is the heart of the city. The bustling square has hundreds of thousands of
people. The stores are skyscrapers, the billboards are gigantic. The lights are
dazzling. You are awestruck by this city that never slee-
No, my mistake, that's Times Square. Downtown Fredericksburg is ok, I guess.
---
Crown Jewelers
contents:ring
There are arguably too many shiny objects here. Even the slightest amount of
light is reflected and brilliantly magnified by all of the exquisitely cut
diamonds. The light and beauty is unbearable, you must avert your eyes.
---
Caroline and Hanover
There is a light breeze, and the air is warm. The two stars still visible
despite all the light pollution are shining brightly. People seem happy, you 
think you might jsut be happy too. Neato, enough of that, moving on.
---
Soup and Taco Etc
contents:soup,taco
Delicious food is being pushed to mostly happy customers. It's a small, homey
restaurant. There is a large mirror on one wall that half of the people are
checking themselves out in at any given moment.
---
Benny Vitali's
contents:sliceOfPizza
The interior is dark. You feel like you've made it. There is a cone of light
coming from the heavens in the center of the room. It illuminates a pedestal,
placed just for you.
---
The River
contents:raft
It must have rained recently, and rained a lot, because the usually calm river
is roaring. White capped waves are plentiful. There's a grizzly bear on the
opposite shore catching salmon with its mouth. You feel as if you're watching
a nature documentary or extreme sports video.
